# Project Wargaming Stats Search Engine

### Description

This is a World of Tanks and World of Warships Player, Clans and Vehicle Search Engine. It uses Twitter Bootstrap version 3 and some basic JQuery libriaries for a modern user expirience. My main goal with this project is to improve a standardized flat solution which can be simply customized with your own needs, wishes and look & feel.
